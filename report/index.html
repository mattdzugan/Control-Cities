         <p>Every time I get on <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/the-californians/n13474" target="_blank">the 405 North</a> in Los Angeles and see that sign: <span class="justTheFont">I-405 to Sacramento</span>,
           I always think it's a bit weird.  <i>That's supposed to help me?</i>
           Sacramento is 6 hours away and there's plenty of other places that we Angelenos are probably actually headed to in-between.
           Sherman Oaks, San Fernando, Santa Clarita... hell even Bakersfield or Fresno seem more relevant.
           Or on the other hand, if you're gonna go big, why not just say Seattle?
        </p>
        <p>I guess my point is... <i>what's the deal with these signs?</i>
          You can't tell me you haven't wondered.
          I mean your GPS navigation's voice reads them to you all the time!
          Which cities do they use?  How'd they decide on them? Which city has the most miles of signage?
          Is there a city that has a sign a ridiculous distance away?  What is the meaning of life?
       </p>
        <h2>Collecting the data</h2>
        <p>
          Like any good internetting detective I started on wikipedia and quickly learned that the
          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_State_Highway_and_Transportation_Officials">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a>
          calls these
          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_city">Control Cities</a>,
          and <a target="_blank" href="http://scote.transportation.org/Pages/Interstate-Control-Cities.aspx">publishes a list</a> of them,
          but it's only got a handful of interstates and no juicy details of where along the routes each city appears on signs.
        </p>
        <p>
          So to determine the control city along both directions of every interstate in the US, I politely asked my computer to querey Google Directions for 459,072 carefully chosen pairs of starting-points & destinations.

        <h2>Mapping the cities</h2>
        <p>
          Armed with a giant stack of verbal directions from anywhere to anywhere, we can now start stringing them together to make some sense of it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The map below shows the segments of signage for each city on the interstate.
          Hover (or tap) on the gray segments to explore which city is which.
          <br><br>
          <select class="singleHighwayDropDown"> <!-- https://select2.github.io/examples.html#data -->

        <p>
          It should be noted that I removed all non-city things like airports, bridges, roads, universities, states,
          <a href="https://media.tenor.co/images/306f5f1728bb4135a143efcc8008ceda/tenor.gif" target="_blank">countries</a> etc...
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a couple patterns that jump out right away.
          If you're like me and you've logged your fair share of interstate miles, you'll find these intuitive.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cities are generally signed from both directions with a signage gap in the middle where the actual city is.
            Usually there are signs for specific roads and exits when approaching the city center, so this makes sense.
            <a>GOOD EXAMPLE</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Signage for a given city from a given direction is not necessarily continuous.
            Again... We've all experienced this.  Sometimes a route towards a big city can be temporarily overtaken by a medium sized city.
            <a>GOOD EXAMPLE</a>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          One thing that came by surprise to me though, was how often there are cities that are only signed from one direction.
          <a>GOOD EXAMPLES</a>
          It would definitely be harder to notice this as a driver as it's not often that you're comparing signs from one direction of your trip to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          After seeing a few of the maps above, you start to wonder: <i>Which cities show up the most often?</i>
          I wrestled with the different ways to answer that.
          On one hand, we want to see which city has the most mileage of signage,
          but on the other hand if we think of the whole region around the highway as being the territory of that city,
          then we can create a map the territorial regions of each city - which just sounds cool.
          So let's explore both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select a few cities:<br>
          <select class="cityMapVizDropDown" multiple="multiple"> <!-- https://select2.github.io/examples.html#data -->
          </select>
        </p>
        <figure>
          <svg class="cityMapVizMap"></svg>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">
            Go all the way down the rabbit hole in <a href="./map.html">Full Screen Mode</a>.
          </figcaption>
        </figure
        <p style="margin-top:-12px"></p>
        <p>
          The territory area in these maps is the region for which that section of interstate is the closest section of interstate.
          In other words, every person living in Seattle's "interstate territory" can say that their closest interstate will point them toward Seattle.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some perspective here: Billings, Montana's "interstate territory" is larger in area than the entire country of Italy. Crazy.
        </p>
        <p>
          A couple interesting observations:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Extending our earlier observation, we see that generally cities tend to be approached from all directions with a donut hole carved out in the middle for local "downtown" signage.
              <br><a href="./map.html#1840018789" target="_blank">Denver</a> is a cool example of this.
            </li>
            <li>
              While signs for highly urban cities do sprawl out directly from the city center, they also show up as small patches in other nearby big cities,
              Leaving the rural gaps in between to be signed for smaller local towns.
              This ultimately creates a "urban-to-urban" and "rural-to-rural" convention.
              <br><a href="./map.html#1840000494and1840001651" target="_blank">St Louis, and Chicago</a> both are good examples of this.
            </li>
            <li>
              Being that the East Coast is generally more population (and thus interstate) dense than the West, East Coast cities have smaller territories.
              <br><a href="./map.html#1840008329and1840020491and1840000455and1840021117and1840006060and1840019941" target="_blank">See for yourself</a>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>


        <h2>City Superlatives</h2>
        <p>
          Enough maps already, let's get to some numbers.
          The table below shows the summary of the statistics for all 1184 signed cities in the lower 48 United States.
          In addition to the mileage and territory stats,
          I've also included the quantity of interstates each city is signed on, as well as the distance from the city center to the farthest sign.

        <h2>Determining which signs go where</h2>
        <p>
          I have no idea how or why the cities were chosen.
          In order to try and wrap my head around the signage we have today, I figured I'd see if I could reproduce it.
         </p>
         <!-- http://whatgiftoday.tumblr.com/post/25648916726 -->
         <p>
          I tried a few different models to try and predict which cities would appear on which signs.
          No, not <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/GF18oM9FxO41i/giphy.gif" target="_blank">that kind of modeling</a>...
          modeling is a word which here means building a fake thing to represent a real thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's put ourselves in the shoes of the sign makers.
          If we had to pick which city we're currently headed towards, we'd probably pick the most prominent city that lies ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what exactly does prominent mean? Who knows!? I tried 7 definitions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#69b93c">Tallest Tower</span> -
            Each member of a city stands on each-other's shoulders forming a giant tower.
            Whichever city's tower appears the tallest from where we are, is the one we pick for the sign.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#58BFAC">Tallest Triangle</span> -
            Members of the city line up in a single file line and kneel on the ground.
            Subsequent members kneel on their backs, and then another group on theirs etc. forming a giant cheerleader triangle.
            Whichever city's triangle appears the tallest from where we are, is the one we pick for the sign.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#4682B4">Tallest Pyramid</span> -
            Members of the city clump together in a square formation and kneel on the ground.
            Subsequent members kneel on their backs, and then another group on theirs etc. forming a giant pyramid.
            Whichever city's pyramid appears the tallest from where we are, is the one we pick for the sign.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#53575A">Tallest Super-Ultra-Hyper-Mega-Meta Tower</span> -
            Each member of a city stands on each-other's shoulders forming a giant stack.
            A photographer takes a photo of this stack and delivers a copy to each citizen.
            The citizens each find a very tall tree and carve a totem pole as a replica of the original tower.
            The citizens all meet the next day and stack their towers together. (yes Los Angeles's tower would go past Pluto)
            Whichever city's tower appears the tallest from where we are, is the one we pick for the sign.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#914D90">Big and Close-ish</span> -
            We pick the most populous city within 500 miles for the sign.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#ED7664">Big and Close</span> -
            We pick the most populous city within 100 miles for the sign.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#FFC445">Big and Very Close</span> -
            We pick the most populous city within 50 miles for the sign.

            Let's take a look at how these various prediction schemes play out using I-55N as an example.
          </p>
          <div   class="simViz" id="simVizAnchorDiv">
            <div class="simViz" id="simVizSimDiv">

              <svg id="sim3" width="720" height="112" class=""></svg>
              <svg id="sim4" width="720" height="112" class=""></svg>
              <svg id="sim5" width="720" height="112" class=""></svg>
              <svg id="sim6" width="720" height="112" class=""></svg>
              <svg id="sim7" width="720" height="112" class=""></svg>
            </div>
            <!--
            <div class="simViz hidden-xs hidden-sm" id="simVizMapDiv"></div>
            -->
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I also have to point out that the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#69b93c">Tallest Tower</span>
          and the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#58BFAC">Tallest Triangle</span>
          prediction schemes actually have some cool corrolaries in the sound-wave-propogation world.
          The perceived loudness of a city full of people chanting in unison would yield the same predictions as our <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#69b93c">Tallest Tower</span> scheme.
          The perceived loudness of a city full of people individually talking (incohenrent grumbling as a group) would yield the same predictions as our <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#58BFAC">Tallest Triangle</span> scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of these schemes are perfect.
          In fact, they all hover around a 1-out-of-3 success rate.
          For every 3 times I see a highway sign, we'll be able to predict the listed city 1 out of those 3 times.
          Which isn't too bad considering these cities were probably determined somewhat arbitrarily 30+ years ago.
